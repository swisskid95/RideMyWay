          <p>
            Cost of transmuting can be shared with all passengers, which would
            help reduce the money spent. You can also reduce the cost of
            repairing and maintaining your car as you can rotate the car used among
            your circle of friends. In addition, with less vehicles on the road,
            less damage would be done to the road therefore reducing the fees
            required for road repair. Save more now by joining and fitting in a
            circle of commuters.

          <p>From wikipedia...  
            Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than
            one person travels in a car , and prevents the need for others to drive to location themselves. By having more people using one vehicle,carpooling reduces each persons travel costs such as: fuel cost, tolls, stress of driving.
